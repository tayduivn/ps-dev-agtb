    'full-description' => '<p>Gannett satisfies news junkies with a stash of daily US papers. The company is the top newspaper publisher in the US with about 80 daily papers boasting a total circulation of about 5 million. Its flagship <Company ID="115987"><em>USA TODAY</em></Company>, with a circulation of 1.8 million, is the nation\'s second-largest newspaper (behind the <Company ID="116127"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></Company>). Other papers in Gannett\'s holdings include <em>The Arizona Republic</em> and the <em>Detroit Free Press</em>. The company also owns about 600 non-daily publications, as well as more than 200 papers in the UK through <Company ID="57821">Newsquest</Company>. In addition, Gannett owns 23 television stations in about 20 markets, publishes periodicals and inserts (including <em>USA WEEKEND</em>), and operates websites for many of its papers.</p>
  <p>Like other newspaper publishers, Gannett relies on both advertising and circulation revenue for the bulk of its sales. The entire industry is struggling through a long and slow decline, however, as readers migrate away from print publications as their principal news source. <em>USA TODAY</em>, meanwhile, has suffered deep declines in revenue resulting in a major restructuring of the operations in 2010. The paper will concentrate less on its print version and focus more on its digital version and delivering content to mobile devices. The restructuring also established new departments such as a multi-media sports content platform called <em>USA TODAY</em> Sports and eliminated 130 jobs.</p>

<p>Gannett cut about 1,400 positions from its workforce during 2009, mostly from its community newspaper operations. In addition to layoffs, the company is trying to increase efficiencies through consolidation. Many of its newsrooms have become digital media hubs that create and distribute content to both print and digital media products, resulting in smaller printed editions augmented by more stories appearing online. Some of the company\'s papers have scaled back print production and delivery even further. Detroit Media Partnership, a joint operating agency (JOA) that oversees the company\'s <em>Free Press</em> and its rival <em>Detroit News</em> (owned by <Company ID="41223">MediaNews Group</Company>), cut home delivery of the papers to three times a week in 2009.</p>

<p>Largely as a result of its cost containment efforts, Gannett has been able to stabilize its profits even though newspaper revenue continues to decline. Its financial picture has also been helped by improvements in company\'s broadcasting operations, which account for about 15% of sales. Gannett is also counting on investments in digital media to start to pay off when a general recovery in the economy brings increased spending by advertisers. The company owns several online businesses, including comparison shopping site <Company ID="124952">ShopLocal</Company> and online advertising company <Company ID="110016">PointRoll</Company>, and it has investments in <Company ID="59009">CareerBuilder</Company> (50%), <Company ID="60756">Classified Ventures</Company> (24%), and <Company ID="132605">Topix</Company> (33%). In addition, Gannett developed and promoted news applications for both the iPhone and iPad from <Company ID="12644">Apple</Company>, as well as the Android platform.</p>
