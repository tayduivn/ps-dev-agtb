/**
 * Bug 59210 - Editing a modules field in Studio does not take affect immediately
 * in metadata API requests.
 *
 * This test confirms that when certain metadata containing elements are edited
 * in studio that they indeed clear the metadata cache. While bug 59210 is specific
 * to field edits, the same condition existed among all studio related editable
 * elements, which was the metadata cache was not being invalidated when edits
 * were made.
 *
 * NOTE: this will be a fairly long running test since it will be testing cache
 * clearing of the API metadata after certain UI tasks are carried out.
